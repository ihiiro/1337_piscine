find files and evaluate an expression on each match:

example: find . -type f \( -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' \) -print -a -delete

parentheses are required for the find command (something to do with 
precedence). They are required if you want the expressions to be evaluated 
on all matches.

bonus: -a and -o stand for logical AND and logical OR respectively.
-print, -delete are called expressions.
